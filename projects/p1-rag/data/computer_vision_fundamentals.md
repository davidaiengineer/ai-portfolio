Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that can process, analyze, and extract meaningful information from digital images and videos, mimicking human visual perception.

## Core Concepts

### Digital Images
Digital images are represented as matrices of pixels, where each pixel contains intensity values:
